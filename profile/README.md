# Automa - Extremely Simple Automation
ðŸ¤– Automa is a project that focuses on making AI & AI automation available to the general public at a low-low cost of 10$ for the base hosted plan, or 0$ for self hosting all of our infrastructure.

ðŸŽ¯ Automa aims to make any social media automation possible by simply spending 5-10 minutes configuring something, and then having it working for you. This is a powerful method of growing social accounts for any purpose, be it advertising dropshipping general-growth or anything else!

ðŸ’ª Automa aims to expand its capabilities via open-source contributions, paid subscriptions / credit systems and more. This allows the developers looking to make valuable contributions to also get a cut of profits, and them starting up their own spin on this project.

We are open for any collaborations. Specifically, we are looking for a fellow Kotlin Developer for the Android App, and a Designer for the Web, Android and IOS. We don't have money to pay anyone currently. Here is what you get from becoming a collaborator: 

1. Real world experience you can list on your resmume, Portfolio and Linkedin.
2. Depending on how much value you provide, you can make a big percentage of all profits.
3. The earlier you start the beter: The project idea is truly unique, and there is no doubt that this will get big in the upcoming months and years. The earlier you join us, the better.
