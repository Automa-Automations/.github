# Automa - Extremely Simple Automation
ðŸ¤– Automa is a project that focuses on making AI & AI automation available to the general public at a low-low cost of 10$ for the base hosted plan, or 0$ for self hosting all of our infrastructure.

ðŸŽ¯ Automa aims to make any social media automation possible by simply spending 5-10 minutes configuring something, and then having it working for you. This is a powerful method of growing social accounts for any purpose, be it advertising dropshipping general-growth or anything else!

ðŸ’ª Automa aims to expand its capabilities via open-source contributions, paid subscriptions / credit systems and more. This allows the developers looking to make valuable contributions to also get a cut of profits, and them starting up their own spin on this project.
