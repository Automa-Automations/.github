ðŸ¤– Automa is a project that focuses on making AI and AI automation available to the general public at a low cost of $10 for the base hosted plan, or $0 for self-hosting all of our infrastructure.

ðŸŽ¯ Automa aims to make any social media automation possible by simply spending 5-10 minutes configuring something, and then having it work for you. This is a powerful method of growing social accounts for any purpose, be it advertising, dropshipping, general growth, or anything else!

ðŸ’ª Automa aims to expand its capabilities via open-source contributions, paid subscriptions/credit systems, and more. This allows developers looking to make valuable contributions to also get a cut of profits, and start their own spin on this project.

We are open to any collaborations. Specifically, we are looking for a fellow Kotlin Developer for the Android app, and a Designer. We don't have money to pay anyone yet, but here is what you get from becoming a collaborator: 

1. Real-world experience you can list on your resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn.
2. Depending on how much value you provide, you can make a significant percentage of all profits.
3. The earlier you start, the better: The project idea is truly unique, and there is no doubt that this will get big in the upcoming months and years. The earlier you join us, the better.
