# Contributions Guide:
Read this guide and follow it whenever you think about contributing.

## 1. How to contribute:
Whenever you see something you want to improve, or you see some spelling mistake or anything wrong with the code, it would be appreciated to create a PR based off of the suggested rules outlined below.

If you think about integrating a big feature, that will take some time to do, notify us first by getting in contact with us. Contact details provided down below.

### 1.1. Identify the problem:
Make an issue on for the associated repository, outlining the problem. Follow our <a href="" target="_blank">Issues Template</a>. Give as accurate and as much detail as possible.
### 1.2. Fork and fix problem:
Fork the repository, and fix the problem. Follow industry level code practices, format the code well, add in comments and meaningful logs where it might be helpful. Follow a consistent commit convention, I recommend using <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/" target="_blank">commitizen</a>, as this will standardize all the commits throughout the codebase. 
### 1.3. Pull Request:
Follow the <a href="" target="_blank">Pull Request Template</a>, replacing the placeholders. Give as much proof as possible, don't leave sections open. 
### 1.4. Feedback:
If your code quality is up to standard, and you followed great practises outlined above, we will just merge. If not, don't feel discouraged. Making small mistakes are a part of the process. If needed, we will give some feedback on what you can fix. We aren't too strict, don't worry.
