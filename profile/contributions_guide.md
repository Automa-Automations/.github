Read this guide and follow it whenever you think about contributing.

## 1. How to Contribute

Whenever you see something you want to improve, or you notice a spelling mistake or anything wrong with the code, it would be appreciated if you could create a pull request (PR) based on the suggested rules outlined below.

If you're considering integrating a significant feature that will take some time, please notify us first by getting in contact with us. Contact details are provided below.

### 1.1. Identify the Problem

Create an issue for the associated repository, outlining the problem. Follow our [Issues Template](link-to-template). Provide as accurate and as much detail as possible.

### 1.2. Fork and Fix Problem

Fork the repository and fix the problem. Follow industry-level code practices, format the code well, and add comments and meaningful logs where they might be helpful. Follow a consistent commit convention; I recommend using [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/), as this will standardize all the commits throughout the codebase.

### 1.3. Pull Request

Follow the [Pull Request Template](link-to-template), replacing the placeholders. Provide as much proof as possible, and don't leave sections open.

### 1.4. Feedback

If your code quality is up to standard and you followed great practices outlined above, we will merge it. If not, don't feel discouraged. Making small mistakes is part of the process. If needed, we will give some feedback on what you can fix. We aren't too strict, don't worry.
