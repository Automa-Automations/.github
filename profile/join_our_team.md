Are you looking to become a contributor for Automa Automations? Read this.

## 1. What is Automa Automations?

Automa Automations is software where our primary goal is to automate content creation and scheduling, leveraging AI. We aim to save content creators time, money, and headaches.

## 2. What is our long-term vision?

Our long-term vision is to support all social media platforms. We aim to automate any type of content you can think of, whether that is shorts, long videos, blogs, tweets, and much more.

## 3. Why are we looking for developers to join our team?

We are primarily looking for a Designer and a Kotlin Developer. Nonetheless, any type of development is welcome, from web development, back-end development, and iOS app development. Although we aren't offering money yet, these are the benefits of becoming a part of our team:
1. If you are quite new, you get actual real-world experience by collaborating with us. You can put this on your resume, LinkedIn, or portfolio. This will significantly increase the chance of you getting hired later on compared to someone with no experience.
2. By collaborating early, there is no doubt that you will reap the results for the value you provide. As soon as Automa Automations starts bringing in profits, you will be rewarded exponentially compared to those who join us later on.
3. Learn how to work in a team. We are currently two developers (my brother and I). You will follow industry-level practices, leveling up your coding and collaboration skills.
4. There is not a lot of competition: Since we aren't a big tech corporation yet, it is really easy to become one of the top contributors.
5. It is more impressive to be one of the top contributors for a smaller software than to be one of the top 200 contributors for freeCodeCamp's repository. You get more for what you put in.
