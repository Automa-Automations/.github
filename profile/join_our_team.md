Read this guide and follow it whenever you think about contributing.

## 1. How to Contribute:

Whenever you see something you want to improve, notice a spelling mistake, or find anything wrong with the code, it would be appreciated if you create a PR based on the suggested rules outlined below.

If you are considering integrating a big feature that will take some time to complete, notify us first by getting in contact with us. Contact details are provided below.

### 1.1. Identify the Problem:

Create an issue for the associated repository, outlining the problem. Follow our <a href="" target="_blank">Issues Template</a>. Provide as much detail as possible.

### 1.2. Fork and Fix the Problem:

Fork the repository and fix the problem. Follow industry-level coding practices, format the code well, and add comments and meaningful logs where they might be helpful. Maintain a consistent commit convention. We recommend using <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/" target="_blank">commitizen</a> to standardize all the commits throughout the codebase.

### 1.3. Pull Request:

Follow the <a href="" target="_blank">Pull Request Template</a>, replacing the placeholders. Provide as much proof as possible; don't leave sections open.

### 1.4. Feedback:

If your code quality is up to standard and you followed the practices outlined above, we will merge your PR. If not, don't feel discouraged. Making small mistakes is a part of the process. If needed, we will give feedback on what you can fix. We aren't too strict, don't worry.
